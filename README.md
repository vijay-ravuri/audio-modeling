At the moment my first goal is finish this recommender system and get a working applet up and running.

Once I have that, clean up my notebooks and get them presentable then consider going further in depth with any of them.

Once I feel the project is complete I'll reassess whether I have time to get the streamlit app running remotely and do that if I have time.

Otherwise, readme then presentation as always.
